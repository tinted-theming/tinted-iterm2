Base16 Default and Base16 Default 256

## "256" Variations

The 256 variations are provided for those people who use a lot of
colored command line programs and wish to keep the default 16 ANSI
colors intact. If this means nothing to you please make use of the
default 16 color versions (the files without 256 in them). On the other
hand if you'd like to keep your 16 ANSI colors intact, go ahead and use
the 256 color variations but please note you'll need to modify some of
the 256 colorspace with the [Base16 Shell][2] script.

**Note:** Use `itermcolors-256/base16-*-256.itermcolors`.
`itermcolors/base16-*256.itermcolors` is deprecated and exists for
backward compatible reasons.
